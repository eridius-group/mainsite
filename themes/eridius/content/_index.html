    <h2>Who we are.</h2>
    <p>
        Our goal is to produce user-friendly, privacy-respecting, security-focused, source-available software for
        <b>you</b>. We will never use your data to target you with advertisements, sell your data to third parties,
        or use what you do in some irrelevant AI. We are a for-profit organization that believes in the privacy and
        safety of the user.

        <h2>Privacy is not optional.</h2>
        <p>
            At Eridius, we make every effort possible to respect your privacy. We only collect information needed to
            keep the consumer safe - we don't use invasive analytics, we don't target you with exploitative
            advertisements, and we never sell your information.</p>
        <p> Most AI we use is ran locally on your machine,
            and we never use your private data to train an AI. In fact - anything that isn't a probable violation of
            terms of service, or hasn't been reported by another user, will never be seen by any AI model on
            Eridius servers.

        <p> All Eridius projects use encryption in one way or another. Every website ran by Eridius uses the latest in
            encryption algorithms, and is protected by Cloudflare. Further, we enforce industry-standard security practices
            for both users and employees. Rest assured, your trust is safe with Eridius.
        </p>

            <summary>More Details...</summary>
            <p> We use Argon2id for password protection - which is resistant against most forms of attack. A lot
                of your personal conversations and data remains encrypted with Pretty Good Protection (PGP) keys. We use HTTP/3,
                courtesy of Cloudflare, and Cloudflare provisions our SSL certificates. We make an effort to encrypt data
                expected to be private client-side, in addition to encryption server-side.
            </p>
            <p> Server-side encryption may not
                protect your data from a hacker with complete control of our servers, but it does protect your data if
                someone gains access to our database. Further, this encryption makes it harder to determine what data is
                encrypted with your client-side key and what data is encrypted with our server-side key. This kind of onion
                protection is standard with Eridius.
